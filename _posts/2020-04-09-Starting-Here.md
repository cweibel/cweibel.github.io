# First Brain Dropping

I've been thinking about writing a blog for a long time.  I have a short memory and quickly forget the details of things I learn from day to day.

I'm hoping to add all sorts of random bits of string, shiny code and other things to line the nest of my memory. 

## Credit Where Credit is Due

I followed [http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to setup this blog site.  

Setting up Jekyll should not have been this hard!

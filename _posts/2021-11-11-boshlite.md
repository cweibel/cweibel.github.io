I've written a whole bunch of blogs about running Cloud Foundry on Kubernetes.  They all work, to varying degrees of success and have the support of a smattering of communities (read: companies with large budgets + engineers + open source ideals).

Sometimes you just want BOSH.  That sweet, sweet, familiar BOSH. Enter `bosh-lite`.


## What is `bosh-lite`?

`bosh-lite` works by spinning up a VM and placing BOSH on it.  From there, you can use it to spin `cf-deployment`, `zookeeper`, or anything else that has a BOSH manifest.

The BOSH director is configured with runtime configs, cloud configs, stemcells, releases and all the other BOSH-like functionality you've come to expect.

## Installation

The tool has been around forever, with a very good tutorial on installing and configuring `bosh-lite` located at [https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-lite/](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-lite/).  The rest of this blog assumes that you have followed these instructions up to step #7.

I had an issue with a newer version of VirtualBox (6.1.28), what worked for me is version 6.1.26 which is available [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_6_1).

It ends with an example deployment of `zookeeper` which I guess is cool, but I'm guessing most BOSH directors are associated with a Cloud Foundry deployment.  Read on for tips that maybe aren't obvious from the documentation!

## Deploying Cloud Foundry

In `cf-deployment`-land there is documentation for using BBL to deploy `bosh-lite` and CF to [GCP or AWS](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/tree/main/iaas-support/bosh-lite).  I point these instructions out in case you have an unlimited IAAS budget, however I'll show you how to deploy this to your Mac.

There is also a Readme within `cf-deployment` [For Operators Deploying CF to local bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/1b2367f37cea2dffa1ab35d5935c08937096bc72/texts/deployment-guide.md#for-operators-deploying-cf-to-local-bosh-lite).  I'll be using this as the basis for the scripting below.

### Clone `cf-deployment`

For these examples, I've assumed you will clone the CF repo to your home folder:

```
cd ~

https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment.git
```


### Setup BOSH Environment variables

This is spread across a few places in the documentation, I've gathered them all together:

```
export CREDHUB_SERVER=https://192.168.50.6:8844
export CREDHUB_CLIENT=credhub-admin
export CREDHUB_SECRET=$(bosh interpolate ~/deployments/vbox/creds.yml --path=/credhub_admin_client_secret)
export CREDHUB_CA_CERT="$(bosh interpolate ~/deployments/vbox/creds.yml --path=/credhub_tls/ca )"$'\n'"$( bosh interpolate ~/deployments/vbox/creds.yml --path=/uaa_ssl/ca)"

export BOSH_CLIENT=admin
export BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET="$(bosh int ~/deployments/vbox/creds.yml --path /admin_password)"
export BOSH_CA_CERT="$(bosh interpolate ~/deployments/vbox/creds.yml --path /director_ssl/ca)"
export BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=vbox

bosh alias-env vbox -e 192.168.50.6 --ca-cert <(bosh int ~/deployments/vbox/creds.yml --path /director_ssl/ca)
```

You might consider adding this to your bash/zsh profile.


### Upload Stemcell, Cloud Config and Runtime Config

```
bosh upload-stemcell --sha1 f399044d2ebe3351f0f1b0b3f97ef11464d283b4 "https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-xenial-go_agent?v=621.125"
bosh update-runtime-config ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/runtime-configs/dns.yml --name dns
bosh update-cloud-config ~/cf-deployment/iaas-support/bosh-lite/cloud-config.yml
```

As time goes by, CF may complain of wanting a newer stemcell version, update the `bosh upload-stemcell` command with the requested version.  The version and `sha1` are listed [here](https://bosh.io/stemcells/bosh-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-bionic-go_agent), note that `bosh-lite` uses `warden` stemcells.

### Go Get a Drink

This part will take around 45 minutes to complete, unless you've changed the IP address of the BOSH director, the following command will deploy CF.

```
cd ~/cf-deployment
bosh -e 192.168.50.6 -d cf deploy \
  cf-deployment.yml \
  -o operations/bosh-lite.yml \
  -v system_domain=bosh-lite.com 
```

### Log Into CF

This is done in two steps, targeting the API and then logging in, pulling the admin password out of credhub without printing it to the screen:

```
cf api https://api.bosh-lite.com --skip-ssl-validation
cf login -u admin -p $(credhub get -n $(credhub find -n admin | grep cf_admin | cut -d: -f2) | grep value | cut -d: -f2) -o system -s test
```

Tada!

Create a space and start pushing apps.




### (Optional) Setup SSH to BOSH Director

Why?  I like to be able to SSH to my BOSH Director to poke around.  I'm weird.  This is not required for the CF deployment, but nice to have: 

```
bosh int ~/deployments/vbox/creds.yml --path /jumpbox_ssh/private_key > ~/deployments/vbox/jumpbox.key
chmod 600 ~/deployments/vbox/jumpbox.key
ssh jumpbox@192.168.50.6 -i ~/deployments/vbox/jumpbox.key
```




## Beware of Dragons


### Issue #1 - Reboot

Rebooting your Mac causes `bosh-lite` to misbehave, badly, unless you take a couple easy steps.

Before shutdown:

 - In Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager select the VM, right click and navigate to `Close` > `Save State`

After reboot:

 - In Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager select the VM, right click and navigate to `Start` > `Headless Start`

Even performing these steps I can't always bring the BOSH Director back online.

If you have accidentally rebooted the host you can recreate the BOSH director using the state file and use `bosh cck` to recover the broken CF deployment:

```
cd ~/deployments/vbox

bosh create-env ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/bosh.yml \
  --state ./state.json \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/virtualbox/cpi.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/virtualbox/outbound-network.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/bosh-lite.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/bosh-lite-runc.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/uaa.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/credhub.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/jumpbox-user.yml \
  --vars-store ./creds.yml \
  -v director_name=bosh-lite \
  -v internal_ip=192.168.50.6 \
  -v internal_gw=192.168.50.1 \
  -v internal_cidr=192.168.50.0/24 \
  -v outbound_network_name=NatNetwork --recreate
  
bosh cck
```

If that doesn't work, you can completely wipe and recreate the BOSH and CF deployment by:

 - Logging into Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager, select the VM, right click and select `Remove` > `Delete all files`
 - Delete the state file at `~/deployments/vbox/state.json`
 - Rerun the `bosh create-env` command then redeploy CF.

### Issue 2 - Networking issues 
If you get:

```
Deploying:
  Creating instance 'bosh/0':
    Waiting until instance is ready:
      Post "https://mbus:<redacted>@192.168.50.6:6868/agent": dial tcp 192.168.50.6:6868: connect: connection refused

Exit code 1
```

You probably skipped the step to add the host routing:

```
sudo route add -net 10.244.0.0/16     192.168.50.6
```

## Final Thought

We all deserve nice things.  `bosh-lite` is one of those nice things for folks who enjoy BOSH and want to use it on their own computer.

Enjoy!
